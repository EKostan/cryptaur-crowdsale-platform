## ABOUT

We are a spirited FinTech startup on a mission to disrupt the traditional commercial channels through the utilization of blockchain technology. Specifically, Cryptaur aims to create a decentralized ecosystem with a focus on establishing a fully transparent platform for consumers. This transparency is implemented via a blockchain technology, that of which allows for users to maintain their original payment habits, avoid the need to learn about cryptocurrency complexities, and dramatically shallows the steep learning curve associated with this technology.

In essence, Cryptaur is a decentralized applications store with a mission to transform and ultimately allow for the implementation of a reinvented shared economic system. Rooted in its mission to bring person to person interaction to the forefront of consumerism, Cryptaur’s platform is grounded in blockchain, a technology that can be employed to hone in on the benefits of decentralization while bringing it to mainstream audiences. Cryptaur’s ecosystem curates products and services for enhanced consumer and community driven trust.


## OUR VISION

We believe that technology is more than a means to an end, and should be accessible to all regardless of their technical knowledge. We believe that consumers are entitled to transparent information to make better decisions, and as a result, our socially driven ecosystem ensures that  consumer’s interests are at the core of commercial transactions.

The Cryptaur vision is to make decentralized technologies available to consumers. Cryptaur is building an ecosystem for dApps (“decentralized applications”) that benefits the consumers the most. This ecosystem is owned by the community of consumers themselves. An example of a dApp could be peer to peer ride sharing and you can read more about it, here.
